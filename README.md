## Overview

### About Project

This project is a classic task management app that is used to distribute and manage the various tasks in a company or organization. You can create, edit and delete projects and also create, edit and delete tasks of those projects. You can also keep track of the different stages of a given task like Eg: Todo, Doing, and Done. You can also keep track of the different subtasks associated with a given task. It has responsive design for desktop, tablet and mobile screens. I used React and Styled-Components with a desktop first workflow for the front-end and node.js and ElephantSQL/Postgres database for the back-end. It is fully online on a Heroku server.
